# ULB
Ultra Load Balancer
Ever wanted to have always-responding DNS or LDAP server : ULB is for you!

Only tested on Debian 12 Bookworm. 

You need 2 machines (physical,vm or container) with at least 2 network interfaces.
The first interface is the management of the machine, the second will be the load-balanced redirector.

In my example i will use 2 machines
